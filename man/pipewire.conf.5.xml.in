  <description>
    <p>PipeWire is a service that allows access to multimedia devices
    and allows media sharing between applications. </p>

    <p>On startup, the daemon reads a configuration file to configure
    itself. It executes a series of commands listed in the config
    file.</p>

    <p>The config file in the default location is used but the
    environment variable PIPEWIRE_CONFIG_FILE can be used to specify
    an alternative config file.</p>
