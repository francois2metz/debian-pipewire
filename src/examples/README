# Running the examples

A pipewire daemon needs to be running for the examples to connect to:

``` shell
./pw-uninstalled.sh
./build/src/daemon/pipewire
```

You can then run the examples in a second terminal, for example:

``` shell
./pw-uninstalled.sh
./build/src/examples/local-v4l2
```

This assumes the development package for `SDL2` was installed, check the meson
build definition in `src/examples` to find out the dependencies for each
example.
